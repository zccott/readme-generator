# Readme Creator - AI-Powered Readme Generator

A brief description of what this project does and who it's for.

## Description

Readme Creator is a web-based application designed to help developers create professional and well-structured README files for their projects. The application provides a user-friendly interface with pre-designed templates for common README sections. Users can add, edit, and reorder sections, with a live markdown preview of the final output.

A key feature of this application is the integration with the Gemini AI. By providing a Google Generative AI API key, users can leverage the power of AI to optimize and enhance the content of their README, ensuring clarity and impact.

The application is built with React and Redux for state management, and uses Material-UI for some UI components.
